Hi {{FirstName}},

I’m reaching out because we’re working with San Antonio companies that occasionally need **extra hands fast** - but don’t want the payroll, HR, or recruiting headache that comes with it.

Quick question:
When you have a last-minute staffing gap (call-outs, sudden demand, short projects), how do you usually handle it today?

We're building a platform to enable a local on-demand staffing service where:

* You tell us what you need (role, headcount, time)
* Workers confirm instantly
* We handle payroll, taxes, insurance, and compliance
* You pay only for hours worked — no contracts

If a job can be trained in ~10–15 minutes and you don’t need the same person every day, we tend to be a good fit.

I’d love to grab **15 minutes** to understand your current setup and see if there’s an opportunity to help. If it makes sense, we’re happy to run a **no-risk demo shift at our expense**.

Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Mike
